# DreamHost Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your Node.js server on DreamHost:

## 1. Install Dependencies

SSH into your DreamHost account and run these commands:

```bash
# Go to your website directory
cd ~/myghostrep

# Install Express
npm install
```

## 2. Verify Node.js Path

Check your actual Node.js path:

```bash
which node
```

If the output is different from `/home/dh_rtrb66/.nvm/versions/node/v16.19.1/bin/node`, update the `.htaccess` file with the correct path.

## 3. Create tmp Directory for Passenger

```bash
mkdir -p ~/myghostrep/tmp
touch ~/myghostrep/tmp/restart.txt
```

## 4. Enable Passenger in DreamHost Panel

1. Log in to DreamHost Panel
2. Go to Domains â†’ Manage Domains
3. Find your domain and click "Edit"
4. Under "Web Options", check "Passenger (Ruby/NodeJS/Python apps only)"
5. Save changes

## 5. Test the Server

You can manually start the server to test it:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see a message that the server is running.

## 6. Restart Passenger

Touch the restart.txt file to tell Passenger to restart your application:

```bash
touch ~/myghostrep/tmp/restart.txt
```

## 7. Check Logs if Issues Persist

If you still have issues, check the error logs:

```bash
cat ~/logs/myghostrep.com/http/error.log
```

## Common Issues

### "Module not found" errors

Make sure Express is installed:

```bash
cd ~/myghostrep
npm install express
```

### Wrong Node.js version

Update the .htaccess file with your correct Node.js path.

### Passenger not recognizing your app

Ensure you have the correct directory structure and valid package.json.
