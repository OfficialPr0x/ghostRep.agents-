Hi {{firstName}},

Just wanted to give you a heads-up that we're opening our {{offerName}} to just 5 companies in {{industry}} this quarter.

Given our conversation about {{painPoint}}, I thought you might want to know before we finalize selections next week.

No pressure at all - just didn't want you to miss the window if it's still relevant.

Hi {{firstName}},

I've been thinking about what you mentioned regarding {{previousTopic}} and had a quick question:

Have you considered {{alternativeApproach}} as a way to address {{specificChallenge}}?

We've seen several companies in {{industry}} have success with this recently, and it made me think of your situation.

Curious to hear your thoughts when you have a moment.
